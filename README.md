## How To Play 
<a href="https://davekoncsol.github.io/black-jack/"> Click Here To Play</a>
<p> Bet some money, then click start and the first hand will be dealt. After that, you can continue to play by pressing next round and betting.

### Rules
<p> The goal is to hit 21, or to have a number higher than the dealers. If you go over 21, you lose. If the dealer gets 21 right away, you lose. 

### Card Values
* Face Cards = 10
* Number Cards = Their numeric value
* Aces = 1 or 11 (depending on which benefits the player or dealer more.

* Sounds will be added.

## Unsolved Issues
